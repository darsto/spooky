Spooky is a C++14 **cross-platform** OpenGL 2.1/OpenGL ES 2.0 application/game engine.  
It features a common interface for writing application for different platforms while trying to give the developer as much maintainability as possible. Simply saying, it provides simple cross-platform support and a **low-level access** to the engine at the same time.
